# MiscProps

This repository is a collection of useful react tools that I've made throughout building my projects.

# Current Components:

## [FetchData](components/fetchdata)

# Current Hooks:

## [useElementSize](hooks/elementSize)

## [useWindowSize](hooks/windowSize)

## Motivation

After developing useful components or hooks, I usually forget about them- this is unfortunate as some of them are quite useful and can be used over and over. So I decided to make a repository that contains all of the ones I create.

## Code style

Components go inside the components folder, while hooks go inside the hooks folder. Each separate component/hook as its own folder that also has a test usecase/example, as well as comments alongside the code (if not there, TBA for that specific one) to understand why certain methods are used for the component/hook.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>

<ul>
<li>- [<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>] - Is the framework of this repo</li>
</ul>

Each component/hook is only using react.js unless specficially stated otherwise in the header of the file.

## Installation

Simply copying and pasting the hook/component is enough to use it, you may delete or edit them as you like.
If you would like to use any of the hooks/components, please credit me in the file.
